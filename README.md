An ebook I've written for Further Mathematics (VCE)

I've uploading the initial code that I've written for 'Simply Further'. The ebook is written in LaTex and
is basically my first attempt at writing an ebook in LaTex. The basic principles of this book are that 
all the maths is explained in as much detail, and as simply as possible, and can be picked up by any person
regardless of mathematics background.

I'll try to update the code as often as I can, but I'm in between this project, working at University, 
working at my part-time job, and trying to learn other programming languages (Python, you're next!). I aim
to have the book completly finished by the end of this year! I've put an update log below so you can have a brief
overview of the changes I have made over the course of writing the book.

Lastly, the editor I've used to write SimplyFurther in is Gummi (For Windows). It's said to be 'unstable', but I quite
like the features it offers me, especially how the document updates in real time every time I make an edit to the code. 
However, if you know of a better editor which will suit my needs (hopefully something with better image support), please let me know!

Update Log

0.1 Initial Code has been uploaded. Also contains images which are placeholders for the images I want
to have placed in the book.

0.2 Finished the first Chapter! Might add in some artwork to seperate chapters after the book is finished.
